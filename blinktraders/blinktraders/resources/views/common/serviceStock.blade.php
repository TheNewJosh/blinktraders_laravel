Focusing on two more recent innovations, adding Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) and the new earnings analysis tool, investors can begin to appreciate the endless brain hub stationed at thinkorswimâ€™s Chicago office. Starting with FRED, a publicly accessible US Government database of over 400,000 economic data points; think GDP, CPI, treasury rates, median household income, etc. FRED data is used by institutional investors, hedge funds, and other sophisticated trading operations. In its never-ending quest to level the playing field, the thinkorswim team decided to download all the data, process it, build a custom interface to graph it, and brought it to all TD Ameritrade clients
